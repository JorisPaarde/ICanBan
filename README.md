# I CanBan

## ICanBan is an easy to use canban system.

The goal of this website is to deliver an easy and appealing way to manage to do's.
Add items to your to do list, move them to the doing list and eventually to the done list.
It features include among other things, renamable and resizable columns and a dark mode setting.
All data is stored in localstorage so will only be stored in your local browser.
This project was made as a second milestone project for the Code Institute full Stack Web developer course.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

For the colors on this website a soft red yellow and green were chosen.

- Red : The color red is used to draw attention and inspire action. Therefore suited for our "To do" list.
        The user is drawn to the items on the list and inspired to take action on them.

- Yellow : Yellow is a color that stimulates and energizes. Therefore suited for our "Doing" list.
        The user is stimulated and energized to complete these tasks.

- Green : Green revitalizes and encourages ideal for the "Done" section of our page.
        After completing a task revitalized nad encouraged by the color green it's back to work o the next task!

#### Typography

Font: [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles)

About:

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight,
it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini.
A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.
It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures,
a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
